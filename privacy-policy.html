    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>Copyright Notice</h3>
    <p>This privacy policy was written by NotAVGLaw.com and is protected by federal copyright law. It’s not just against the law to copy and paste this for your own website; it’s a really bad idea. The information this website collects is probably different from what you collect, and you haven’t taken our course to understand the importance of the legal promises you’re making here. </p>
    <h3>Defined Terms</h3>
    <p>This is a legal document and you should read it carefully.  </p>
    <p>When the first letter of a word is capitalized in this document, it has a special and specific meaning. We call those words “Defined Terms,” because we’re going to give you a definition of what each term means as used in this document. 
    </p>
    <p>Company – Grace Gutierrez Design LLC </p>
    <p>Website – <a href="www.gracegutierrez.com">www.gracegutierrez.com</a></p>
    <p>Privacy Officer – Grace Gutierrez </p>
    <p>When you see a plural or a plural possessive pronoun, such as “We” and “Our,” that refers to the Company.</p>
    <h3>Collecting and Using Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Most actions you take on the Website will relay certain information about you to the Company.</p>
    <h4>Information Collection Categories</h4>
    <p>Contact Information</p>
    <p>When you fill out our “Contact” form, or make a purchase with Us, we collect the information you provide so we can communicate with you.</p>
    <p>This might include your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. </p>
    <p>If you use social media, and give us your social media information, we use that information to view your social media. Sharing your social media with us may tell us who you follow, who follows you, and your likes or interests. Your privacy settings for social media can be adjusted in the settings menu of your social media provider. </p>
    <p>Profile Information</p>
    <p>When you fill out our contact form, or make a purchase, we create a profile for you so we can identify you. If you purchase a digital product, then we use your information to provide you with access to your purchase. </p>
    <p>As you navigate the Website, your computer relays information to us that we use to optimize the Website, improve user experience, and make strategic business decisions about our products and services. </p>
    <p>We use session analytics, which means that while you are on our Website we are using software to tell us what pages you click on, how long you stay there, and how you generally navigate the Website. This information tells us how we can improve user experience, how successful our advertisements have been, and how to make our content more accessible. </p>
    <p>Analytics, including the session analytics we use, may collect information about your computer specifications, internet connection, and IP address. Your IP address is a unique identifier that tells other computers the path to take to communicate with your device. That kind of data can communicate private information about you. For example, connecting to the internet via a coffee shop’s wifi tells the analytics tool that you are at the coffee shop at the time you access the Website. Smart devices like your smartphone can tell when another smart device is nearby. If a nearby device has given permission to advertisers to access its location, then those advertisers can deduce that you are also near that location. We don't collect your location information, but accessing our Website while near other devices might allow advertisers to deduce your location, and they could send you targeted ads. Also, your computer’s specifications could communicate what kind of device you prefer to use, or what you prioritize in your devices. </p>
    <h3>How Long We Keep Your Information</h3>
    <p>We keep your Contact Information only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We retain Contact Information as required by law, if applicable. We retain Contact Information necessary to enforce legal agreements and resolve disputes. </p>
    <p>We keep your Profile Information as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>Aside from the Contact Information we keep for legal purposes, you can ask us to delete collected information. To do that, contact the Privacy Officer listed at the end of this Privacy Policy. 
    </p>
    <h3>Cookies, Pixels, and Tracking Signals</h3>
    <p>Cookies are not just tasty treats. A cookie is also a piece of information recorded by your web browser. This allows your web browser to recognize places you have visited. For more on cookies, <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy-notices/privacy-policy/internet-cookies">see this article</a> from the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

    <p>Pixels aren’t just the tiny colorful squares on your device’s screen. A pixel, also known as a beacon, or pixel tag, is a transparent image file that tells us something has been clicked on.</p>
    <p>Cookies and pixels may communicate to us the web browser you use, whether you open an email we send, your advertising ID, and other technical information about your device.</p>
    <p>We use these cookies and pixels to track your internet usage in order to implement advertising strategies, and to ensure our servers and systems are working properly.</p>

      <h3>Your European Union Rights</h3>
      <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a law that governs information and privacy rights for people within the European Union. The policy in this section only applies to European Union residents.</p>
      <p>We will retain any information you choose to provide to us until the earlier of: (a) you asking us to delete the information, (b) our decision to cease using our existing data providers, or (c) the Company decides that the value in retaining the data is outweighed by the costs of retaining it.</p>
